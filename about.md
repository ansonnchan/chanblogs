Hi! I'm Anson, a computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). My interests right now is in machine learning and applications of artificial intelligence. In this blog, 
I document my experiences navigating the adult world, reflecting on life, learning, machine learning, AI and everything in between.

I hope you enjoy my posts, take some inspiration and also learn something while you're here.
