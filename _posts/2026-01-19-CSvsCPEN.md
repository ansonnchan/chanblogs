description: "Reflections on choosing between Computer Science and Computer Engineering at UBC"
---

If you’re at UBC trying to choose between **Computer Science (CS)** and **Computer Engineering (CPEN)** — or more broadly, deciding between science and engineering before starting UBC — you’ve probably heard the same piece of advice repeated so many times it might as well be printed on a first-year orientation tote bag:

> *“CS is software, CPEN is hardware — pick based on that.”*

It’s not exactly *wrong*, but it’s also not nearly as helpful as people think it is.

That distinction exists on paper. In real life — especially once you factor in the job market, AI, and what people actually end up doing after graduation — the line gets very blurry, very fast.

---

## The Job Market from a UBC Perspective

At UBC, CS and CPEN students often apply to the **exact same internships and new grad roles**:  
software developer, backend engineer, full-stack developer, systems roles, and even entry-level machine learning positions.

In fact, if you look at the Applied Science Co-op<sup><a href="#coop">1</a></sup> postings, roughly **75% of the jobs listed under CPEN are software-related**<sup><a href="#coop">1</a></sup>. So much for “hardware-only,” I guess.

As you can see above, pretty much all the job postings are in some way related to software. 

When I was debating early in second year whether to switch from CPEN to CS, everyone had *very strong opinions*.  
My CPEN friends would say a **Bachelor of Applied Science** is more “valuable.”  
CS students would confidently say the exact opposite.

At this point, I’d bet my university tuition (which is already working hard to become student debt) that if you asked both sides, they’d always argue for their own program.

The uncomfortable truth?  
**Recruiters usually don’t care.**

They care about whether you can:
- write clean, maintainable code  
- understand algorithms and trade-offs  
- learn new tools without panicking  
- and show proof through projects, internships, or co-op experience  

CS tends to emphasize theory, algorithms, and abstraction earlier.  
CPEN tends to emphasize systems, performance, and how software interacts with real hardware.

Both skill sets are valuable — and at UBC, both are respected  
*(even though CS still catches strays in unemployment jokes… I don’t dislike you guys, but please stop competing with me for internships).*

## AI Is Blurring the Line Even More

The rise of AI has completely warped what “software” even means.

Machine learning today isn’t just about writing Python, importing a model, and randomly doing cross-validation until something looks good. It’s about:
- efficiency  
- scale  
- memory  
- compute  
- and understanding how models actually run on real machines  

CS provides strong foundations in algorithms, math, and data structures — all critical for ML.  
CPEN builds intuition around hardware, memory hierarchies, and performance — which becomes increasingly important when working with GPUs, accelerators, or embedded systems.

Ironically, AI makes the CS vs CPEN divide **less important, not more**.

The people building serious ML systems often live in the uncomfortable middle ground — where theory meets hardware constraints and nothing runs as fast as you want it to.

## Hardware Doesn’t Lock You Out of Software

One of the biggest fears people have about CPEN is that it locks you into hardware forever.

At UBC, that’s… not really true.

Yes, CPEN has a lot of hardware-heavy courses. Off the top of my head:  
CPEN 211, 212, 311, 331<sup><a href="#cpen">2</a></sup> — and that’s not even the full list.

But many CPEN students still end up working almost entirely in software — just with a stronger systems mindset.

That usually shows up as being more comfortable with:
- debugging at ungodly hours  
- performance bottlenecks  
- understanding what’s actually happening under the hood  

You get exposed to lower-level and more foundational programming — Assembly (RISC-V, ARM)<sup><a href="#assembly">3</a></sup>, operating systems, compilers — plus hardware description languages like Verilog and SystemVerilog<sup><a href="#verilog">4</a></sup>.

None of that pulls you *away* from software.  
If anything, it gives you context most people don’t get until much later.

In areas like ML infrastructure, robotics, edge computing, and high-performance systems, that background can quietly become a superpower.

## My Take

For me, CS vs CPEN isn’t about choosing between two completely different futures.

It’s about choosing a **starting point**.

My end goal is pretty clear:  
**working in software and eventually, machine learning**.

Both CS and CPEN can get me there.

What matters way more than the program name is:
- what I build outside of class  
- how deeply I understand the fundamentals  
- and how adaptable I am when the field inevitably changes (again)  

At UBC especially, the ability to cross over — through electives, projects, design teams, internships, and self-study — makes the boundary between CS and CPEN far thinner than it looks on a degree requirement checklist.

---

## Final Thoughts

Choosing between CS and CPEN can feel like a defining decision, especially when everyone around you has an opinion and LinkedIn makes it seem like one wrong move ends your career.

It’s not a life sentence — it’s a launchpad.

In a field shaped by rapid change and AI-driven chaos, adaptability matters more than the label on your degree.

And honestly, the best engineers I’ve met don’t fit neatly into one box anyway.
