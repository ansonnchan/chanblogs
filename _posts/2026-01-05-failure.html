            Starting a blog with this feels a little on-the-nose, doesn't it? A bit depressing. But yesterday, I got a blow I never saw coming. I failed a course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The problem? I fully expected to pass and skip merrily on with my life. The bigger problem? It was a prerequisite for half my future degree—a course only offered once a year, in Winter Term 1.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you're in engineering, or any program for that matter, you know what this means; graduation, most likely delayed by a year. When you factor in co-op, I could be here for over <em>six years</em>. By then, who knows what the job market looks like, especially in AI and machine learning (the fields I'm hoping to work in).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Ironically, this failure is one of the main reasons I decided to start this blog.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I won't lie and say I took it like a champ. I spent the better half of six hours moping, frantically emailing advisors, and doom-scrolling Reddit for escape routes. Then it hit me: no amount of panic would turn back time. I'm stuck retaking this course—spending more money, more hours, with a professor who seems to despise the material more than I do.
        </p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> the course is about hardware. CPUs, GPUs, bits, program counters… it might as well be a foreign language. I hate it with a passion. If you asked my friends what subject makes my eyes glaze over, they'd all say hardware. I joined computer engineering to learn about programming, software, AI, and all that fancy jazz. Why the heck do I want to learn what goes on <em>in</em> a computer? For those who smugly say, "Half of computer engineering is learning about that," I say: <strong>shush</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Here's the uncomfortable truth: if I retook that final right now, I'd probably score below 30%. That's how little I actually understood.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You might be thinking—<em>wait, you expected to pass but now say you'd fail?</em> And you're absolutely right. Turns out, the "knowledge" I was so proud of retaining was just memorization. I didn't want understanding; I wanted the grade. And now? I have neither (this feels like a story straight out of Aesop's Fables).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That's my biggest regret. We're in university to learn, right? Not just to chase letters on a transcript. (Though, let's be real, C's get degrees… just maybe not the jobs. But that's another post.)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When I inevitably retake this course next year, I'm going to do one thing differently: I'm going to <em>learn</em> it. Not memorize it. I'm going to sit through those tedious lectures and ask the stupid questions until the pieces click. This failure is forcing me to build a foundation I skipped—and maybe, in the long run, that's the point.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            But with 102% certainty and a 2% margin of error, you're not going to catch me doing anything hardware related in the future.

            As a final parting note, in the grand scheme of things, this F means nothing. This one year won't even count as a dot if the timeline of the entire universe was laid out. I did the math. The Big Bang happened <strong>13.8 billion years ago</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <div class="math">
            <strong>1 ÷ 13,800,000,000 = 0.0000000000725</strong>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            It won't even register as a rounding error. Perhaps failures are the universe's awkward and annoying way of moving you forward. Sometimes, you have to fail a prerequisite to learn the real lesson.
