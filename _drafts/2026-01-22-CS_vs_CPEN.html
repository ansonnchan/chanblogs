  <strong>The Great UBC Debate: CS vs CPEN 👷‍♂️</strong>
</p>

<p>
As an incoming or first-year UBC student, you've probably heard the same oversimplified advice everywhere, from friends and family, to 
  obscure Reddit threads from 12 years ago. 
</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>
    “CS is software; CPEN is hardware. Pick based on that.
  </em>
</blockquote>

<p>
  <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> It's 2026 and that advice is about as useful as going to an
  8:00 AM lecture that is recorded. It’s not exactly <em>wrong</em>, but it’s also not completely right.
  In the age of AI and a hyper-competitive job market, the line
  between Science and Applied Science is blurring faster than a Gaussian blur (I just learnt that as I am studying for 
  a computer vision online assessment (please don't tell the recruiter)).

<h2>💼 The Job Market Reality Check</h2>

<p>
  The distinction is not as big as you think. If you browse the
  <strong>Applied Science Co-op</strong><sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> portal,
  you’ll notice something funny:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>CPEN Reality:</strong> Roughly
    <strong>75% of the “Hardware” jobs</strong> are actually… software roles. 💻
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Overlap:</strong> CS and CPEN students are routinely fighting for
    the same Backend, Full-Stack, ML jobs. Hey, at this point in time with this kind of oversaturated market,
    even quality assurance engineers and software testing roles which have been looked down upon is harder than a
    FAANG or MANGO (these things keep changing faster than I change my mood) internship back in 2016. 
  </li>
</ul>

  <strong>💡 The Recruiter’s Secret:</strong>
  If you're looking to break into big tech or any software role for that matter like I am, recruiters don’t care if your degree says
  <em>Science</em> or <em>Applied Science</em>. They care if you can ship clean
  code, survive a LeetCode Hard, and learn a new framework without having a
  breakdown (and even LeetCode might not matter as companies like Meta are now
  allowing AI usage in interviews).

<h2>🤖 The AI Paradox: Why “Hardware” Matters for Software</h2>

<p>
  People used to say, <em>“I’m doing CS because I want to do AI.”</em> Today,
  that’s only half the story. High-level Machine Learning isn’t just about
  writing Python scripts; it’s about <strong>Compute, Scale, and Memory.</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The CS Advantage:</strong> You get the deep theoretical math, the
    logic, and the high-level abstractions early on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The CPEN Advantage:</strong> You understand the GPU clusters and the
    memory hierarchies that actually <em>run</em> those models.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Ironically, the rise of AI makes the “CS vs. CPEN” divide
  <strong>less important</strong>, because the most valuable engineers are the
  ones who can live in the middle ground — optimizing models to run on actual
  silicon without burning the server down.

<h2>🛠️ Will CPEN “Lock Me In” to a Lab?</h2>

<p>
  The biggest fear CS-leaning students have about CPEN is getting “stuck” in a
  hardware lab.
</p>

<p>
  Sure, you’ll spend your fair share of time in the MacLeod building wrestling
  with Verilog<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> or debugging RISC-V
  assembly<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> at 2:00 AM. But these aren’t
  distractions; they’re <strong>context.</strong>

<h2>🎯 My Take: It’s a Launchpad, Not a Box</h2>

<p>
  When I was debating a switch from CPEN to CS, I realized something:
  <strong>The degree is just your starting point.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  My goal is Machine Learning and Software Engineering. Both paths lead there.
  The difference is just the flavor of the struggle you choose for four (or
  five) years.
</p>

<p><strong>What actually matters?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>The Projects:</strong> What are you building when no one is grading
    you?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Adaptability:</strong> Can you pivot when AI replaces the task
    you learned last semester?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Grind:</strong> CS and CPEN are both hard. Pick the hard you find
    interesting.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr style="margin: 40px 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #eee;" />

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
  Don’t let the degree name give you an identity crisis. The best engineers I’ve
  met at UBC don’t fit into neat boxes. They’re CS majors who know how to
  overclock a GPU and CPEN majors who can write beautiful React frontend code.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Choose the community and the curriculum that challenges you — the industry
    will take care of the rest.
  </strong>

<h3>📚 Terminology for the Uninitiated</h3>

<p>
  <sup id="1">1</sup> Co-op: UBC’s structured work-experience program, similar to
  internships. CPEN students typically complete five co-op work terms, each
  lasting four months.
  <a href="#top">↩︎</a>
</p>

<p>
  <sup id="2">2</sup> Assembly (RISC-V / ARM): Low-level programming used to
  communicate directly with the CPU. It offers fine-grained control over
  hardware at the cost of readability and developer sanity.
  <a href="#top">↩︎</a>
</p>

<p>
  <sup id="3">3</sup> SystemVerilog / Verilog: Hardware description languages used
  to model and design digital systems. These are commonly used in industry at
  companies such as NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.
